Take a look at what happened w/ Bill Clinton. The system is totally rigged. Does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence? Jul 01, 2016 
Bill Clinton's meeting was a total secret. Nobody was to know about it but he was caught by a local reporter. Jul 01, 2016 
As Bernie Sanders said, Hillary Clinton has bad judgement. Bill's meeting was probably initiated and demanded by Hillary! Jul 01, 2016

The reason I put up approximately $50 million for my successful primary campaign is very simple, I want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Jun 30, 2016 
I have self funded my winning primary campaign with an approx. $50 million loan. I have totally terminated the loan! Jun 30, 2016 
The very dishonest @NBCNews refuses to accept the fact that I have forgiven my $50 million loan to my campaign. Done deal! Jun 30, 2016 
One of the reasons Hillary hid her emails was so the public wouldn't see how she got rich- selling out America. https://t.co/mO9QrmYXRD Jun 30, 2016

Goofy Elizabeth Warren didn’t have the guts to run for POTUS. Her phony Native American heritage stops that and VP cold. May 11, 2016 
Goofy Elizabeth Warren has been one of the least effective Senators in the entire U.S. Senate. She has done nothing! May 11, 2016 
I don't want to hit Crazy Bernie Sanders too hard yet because I love watching what he is doing to Crooked Hillary. His time will come! May 11, 2016 
Big wins in West Virginia and Nebraska. Get ready for November - Crooked Hillary, who is looking very bad against Crazy Bernie, will lose! May 11, 2016

The Clintons spend millions on negative ads on me & I can’t tell the truth about her husband? Don’t feel sorry for crooked Hillary! May 10, 2016 
Hillary has bad judgment! https://t.co/LhcIU6kmxs May 10, 2016 
It was so great being in Nebraska last week. Today is the big day--get out and vote! May 10, 2016 
I look very much forward to meeting w/Paul Ryan & the GOP Party Leadership on Thurs in DC. Together, we will beat the Dems at all levels! May 10, 2016

It was Rosie O'Donnell who ate the cake in the vicious Hillary commercial about me, not Crooked Hillary! @marthamaccallum May 10, 2016 
Why does the media, with a strong push from Crooked Hillary, keep pushing the false narrative that I want to raise taxes. Exactly opposite! May 10, 2016

I am lowering taxes far more than any other candidate. Any negotiated increase by Congress to my proposal would still be lower than current! May 09, 2016 
I will have set the all time record in primary votes in the Republican party --despite having to compete against 17 other people! May 09, 2016 
If I only had 1 person running against me in the primaries like Hillary Clinton, I would have gotten 10 million more votes than she did! May 09, 2016 
Crooked Hillary Clinton says that she got more primary votes than Donald Trump. But I had 17 people to beat—she had one! May 09, 2016

Goofy Elizabeth Warren is weak and ineffective. Does nothing. All talk, no action -- maybe her Native American name? May 07, 2016 
Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant. She is too easy! I'm driving her nuts. May 07, 2016 
Crooked Hillary Clinton wants completely open borders. Millions of Democrats will run from her over this and support me. May 07, 2016

Goofy Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clinton’s flunky, has a career that is totally based on a lie. She is not Native American. May 06, 2016 
Let’s properly check goofy Elizabeth Warren’s records to see if she is Native American. I say she’s a fraud! May 06, 2016

Gov Mike Pence has just stated that Donald Trump has taken a strong stance on Hoosier jobs, and he thanks me! I will bring back jobs to USA. May 02, 2016

Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses. Apr 25, 2016 
Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness! Apr 25, 2016

Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory. They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify! Apr 21, 2016 
Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race. He said Kasich should get out for same reason. I think both should get out! Apr 21, 2016

Cruz said Kasich should leave because he couldn't get to 1237. Now he can't get to 1237. Drop out LYIN' Ted. Apr 21, 2016 
Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory. They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify! Apr 21, 2016 
Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race. He said Kasich should get out for same reason. I think both should get out! Apr 21, 2016 
I will be doing the @TODAYshow with my wife, Melania, and the rest of my family in a major Town Hall. Hopefully, it will be fun! Enjoy.7A.M. Apr 21, 2016

North Carolina lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs and Ohio lost 400,000 since 2000. Going to Mexico etc. NO MORE IF I WIN, WE WILL BRING BACK! Mar 15, 2016

Don't reward Mitt Romney, who let us all down in the last presidential race, by voting for Kasich (who voted for NAFTA, open borders etc.). Mar 15, 2016 
Please remember, I am the ONLY candidate who is self-funding his campaign. Kasich, Rubio and Cruz are all bought and paid for by lobbyists! Mar 15, 2016 
I will bring our jobs back to America, fix our military and take care of our vets, end Common Core and ObamaCare, protect 2nd A, build WALL Mar 15, 2016 
Rubio is weak on illegal immigration, with the worst voting record in the U.S. Senate in many years. He will never MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Mar 15, 2016 
Kasich voted for NAFTA, a disaster for Ohio, and now wants the even worse TPP approved. Vote Trump and end this madness! Mar 15, 2016

I will be going to New Hampshire today, home of my first primary victory, to discuss terror and the horrible events of yesterday. 2:30 P.M. Jun 13, 2016 
I have been hitting Obama and Crooked Hillary hard on not using the term Radical Islamic Terror. Hillary just broke-said she would now use! Jun 13, 2016 
What has happened in Orlando is just the beginning. Our leadership is weak and ineffective. I called it and asked for the ban. Must be tough Jun 12, 2016 
"@WandaWalls20: @realDonaldTrump Please make us safe. We cannot have Hillary as president. We will be in so much trouble. Jun 12, 2016

Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don't want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance. We must be smart! Jun 12, 2016

Join me in San Jose, California- tomorrow evening at 7pm! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 https://t.co/jLQukR550J https://t.co/Uds8OdH3A4 Jun 01, 2016 
So I raised/gave $5,600,000 for the veterans and the media makes me look bad! They do anything to belittle - totally biased. Jun 01, 2016 
Congratulations to @seanhannity on his tremendous increase in television ratings. Speaking of ratings- I will be on his show tonight @ 10pE. May 31, 2016 
I am getting great credit for my press conference today. Crooked Hillary should be admonished for not having a press conference in 179 days. May 31, 2016 
Katie Couric, the third rate reporter, who has been largely forgotten, should be ashamed of herself for the fraudulent editing of her doc. May 31, 2016 
I will be interviewed on @seanhannity tonight at 10pmE on @FoxNews. Enjoy! May 31, 2016 
Join me in Sacramento, California-tomorrow evening @ 7pm! #Trump2016 https://t.co/W7xy7eXcii https://t.co/km0rRYSDnO May 31, 2016 
So many veterans groups are beyond happy with all of the money I raised/gave! It was my great honor - they do an amazing job. May 31, 2016 
Just finished a press conference in Trump Tower wherein I gave information on which VETERANS groups got the $5,600,000 that I raised/gave! May 31, 2016 
I have raised/given a tremendous amount of money to our great VETERANS, and have got nothing but bad publicity for doing so. Watch! May 31, 2016 
So many great things happening - new poll numbers looking good! News conference at 11:00 A.M. today, Trump Tower! May 31, 2016 
I should have easily won the Trump University case on summary judgement but have a judge, Gonzalo Curiel, who is totally biased against me. May 30, 2016 
I have a judge in the Trump University civil case, Gonzalo Curiel (San Diego), who is very unfair. An Obama pick. Totally biased-hates Trump May 30, 2016 
I hope everyone had a great Memorial Day! May 30, 2016 
I would have had millions of votes more in the primaries (than Crooked Hillary) if I only had one opponent, instead of sixteen. Broke record May 30, 2016 
Have a great Memorial Day and remember that we will soon MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! May 30, 2016

The endorsement of me by the 16,500 Border Patrol Agents was the first time that they ever endorsed a presidential candidate. Nice! May 30, 2016 
In getting the endorsement of the 16,500 Border Patrol Agents (thank you), the statement was made that the WALL was very necessary! May 30, 2016 
Obama says a WALL at our southern border won't enhance our security (wrong) and yet he now wants to build a much bigger wall (fence) at W.H. May 30, 2016 
If dummy Bill Kristol actually does get a spoiler to run as an Independent, say good bye to the Supreme Court! May 29, 2016 
The Republican Party has to be smart & strong if it wants to win in November. Can't allow lightweights to set up a spoiler Indie candidate! May 29, 2016 
Bill Kristol has been wrong for 2yrs-an embarrassed loser, but if the GOP can't control their own, then they are not a party. Be tough, R's! May 29, 2016 
Good news is that my campaign has perhaps more cash than any campaign in the history of politics- b/c I stand 100% behind everything we do. May 29, 2016

I am always on the front page of the failing @nytimes, but when I won the GOP nomination, I'm in the back of the paper. Very dishonest! May 28, 2016 
The media is on a new phony kick about my management style. I spend much less money & get much better results! What we need as Prez! May 28, 2016 
The failing @nytimes wrote a story about my management style & that I don't have many people. I have 73, Hillary has 800- & I'm beating her. May 28, 2016

Goofy Elizabeth Warren is weak and ineffective. Does nothing. All talk, no action -- maybe her Native American name? May 07, 2016 
Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant. She is too easy! I'm driving her nuts. May 07, 2016 
Crooked Hillary Clinton wants completely open borders. Millions of Democrats will run from her over this and support me. May 07, 2016 
Just met with courageous family of Sarah Root in Nebraska. Sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant, but leaves behind amazing legacy. May 07, 2016 
Goofy Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clinton’s flunky, has a career that is totally based on a lie. She is not Native American. May 06, 2016 
Let’s properly check goofy Elizabeth Warren’s records to see if she is Native American. I say she’s a fraud! May 06, 2016 
I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate. I will defeat them both. May 06, 2016 
Response to @LindseyGrahamSC: https://t.co/lSDE7LHc95 May 06, 2016 
I hear @JoeNBC of rapidly fading @Morning_Joe is pushing hard for a third party candidate to run. This will guarantee a Crooked Hillary win. May 06, 2016 
Joe Scarborough initially endorsed Jeb Bush and Jeb crashed, then John Kasich and that didn't work. Not much power or insight! May 06, 2016 
Thank you to teachers across America! When I become POTUS we will make education a far more important component of our life than it is now. May 06, 2016 
Crooked Hillary has ZERO leadership ability. As Bernie Sanders says, she has bad judgement. Constantly playing the women's card - it is sad! May 06, 2016 
Paul Ryan said that I inherited something very special, the Republican Party. Wrong, I didn't inherit it, I won it with millions of voters! May 06, 2016

Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses. Apr 25, 2016 
Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness! Apr 25, 2016 
Lyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors & special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad! Apr 25, 2016

On the way to the great state of Rhode Island- big rally. Then to Pennsylvania for rest of day and night! Apr 25, 2016 
Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him. Typical politician - can't make a deal work. Apr 25, 2016 
Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses. Apr 25, 2016 
Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness! Apr 25, 2016 
Lyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors & special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad! Apr 25, 2016 
Wow, just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION! Apr 25, 2016

Cruz said Kasich should leave because he couldn't get to 1237. Now he can't get to 1237. Drop out LYIN' Ted. Apr 21, 2016 
Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory. They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify! Apr 21, 2016 
Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race. He said Kasich should get out for same reason. I think both should get out! Apr 21, 2016

Remember @JebBush wants COMMON CORE (education from D.C.) and is very weak on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION ("come as act of love"). Not a leader! Feb 09, 2016

And finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and "choice" - a total lie! Feb 03, 2016 
The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud Feb 03, 2016

The media has not covered my long-shot great finish in Iowa fairly. Brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history! Feb 02, 2016 
Because I was told I could not do well in Iowa, I spent very little there - a fraction of Cruz & Rubio. Came in a strong second. Great honor Feb 02, 2016 
My experience in Iowa was a great one. I started out with all of the experts saying I couldn't do well there and ended up in 2nd place. Nice Feb 02, 2016

If I would have done the last debate, a record would have been set (instead of the poor ratings recieved). Also, VETS got $6,000,000. Jan 31, 2016 
By not doing the failed, poorly rated debate, I was able to make the point of not allowing "unfairness" - while raising $6,000,000 for VETS. Jan 31, 2016 
Wow, just saw an ad - Cruz is lying on so many levels. There is nobody more against ObamaCare than me, will repeal & replace. He lies! Jan 31, 2016 
Ted Cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important Financial Disclosure Form. Very low interest loans, scam! Jan 31, 2016

Happy birthday to my friend, the great @jacknicklaus - a totally special guy! Jan 21, 2016 
New Day on CNN treats me very badly. @AlisynCamerota is a disaster. Not going to watch anymore. Jan 21, 2016 
Low energy candidate @JebBush has wasted $80 million on his failed presidential campaign. Millions spent on me. He should go home and relax! Jan 21, 2016 
Sad sack @JebBush has just done another ad on me, with special interest money, saying I won't beat Hillary - I WILL. But he can't beat me. Jan 21, 2016 
So sad that @CNN and many others refused to show the massive crowd at the arena yesterday in Oklahoma. Dishonest reporting! Jan 21, 2016

I don't think Ted Cruz can even run for President until he can assure Republican voters that being born in Canada is not a problem. Doubt! Jan 19, 2016 
Ted Cruz is falling in the polls. He is nervous. People are worried about his place of birth and his failure to report his loans from banks! Jan 19, 2016

Iran is going to buy 114 jetliners with a small part of the $150 billion we are giving them...but they won't buy from U.S., rather Airbus! Jan 17, 2016 
In Iran deal we get 4 prisoners. They get $150 billion, 7 most wanted and many off watch list. This will create great incentive for others! Jan 17, 2016 
Interesting read from Peggy Noonan. https://t.co/jAxIy8xseM Jan 17, 2016 
Is this the New York that Ted Cruz is talking about & demeaning? https://t.co/rYGX9vazku Jan 16, 2016 
Wow! Ted Cruz received $487K in campaign contributions, $11M from a NY hedge fund mogul, & $1M low int. loan from Goldman Sachs. Hypocrite Jan 16, 2016

Greatly dishonest of @TedCruz to file a financial disclosure form & not list his lending banks- then pretend he is going to clean up Wall St Jan 16, 2016 
When will @TedCruz give all the New York based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him. Jan 16, 2016 
Everybody that loves the people of New York, and all they have been thru, should get hypocrites like Ted Cruz out of politics! Jan 16, 2016 
If Ted Cruz is so opposed to gay marriage, why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage? Jan 16, 2016

Ted Cruz purposely, and illegally, did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks. They own him! Jan 16, 2016 
Based on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a "natural born Canadian," did he borrow unreported loans from C banks? Jan 16, 2016 
Oh no, just reported that Ted Cruz didn't report another loan, this one from Citi. Wow, no wonder banks do so well in the U.S. Senate. Jan 16, 2016 
The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace. Remember, his wife's employer, and his lender, is located there! Jan 16, 2016 
Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer! Jan 16, 2016 
Ted Cruz said he "didn't know" that he was a Canadian Citizen. He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.Not believable Jan 16, 2016

I will be going to New Hampshire today, home of my first primary victory, to discuss terror and the horrible events of yesterday. 2:30 P.M. Jun 13, 2016 
I have been hitting Obama and Crooked Hillary hard on not using the term Radical Islamic Terror. Hillary just broke-said she would now use! Jun 13, 2016 
What has happened in Orlando is just the beginning. Our leadership is weak and ineffective. I called it and asked for the ban. Must be tough Jun 12, 2016 
"@WandaWalls20: @realDonaldTrump Please make us safe. We cannot have Hillary as president. We will be in so much trouble. Jun 12, 2016

Obama just endorsed Crooked Hillary. He wants four more years of Obama—but nobody else does! Jun 09, 2016 
Crooked Hillary Clinton will be a disaster on jobs, the economy, trade, healthcare, the military, guns and just about all else. Obama plus! Jun 09, 2016 
As expected, the media is very much against me. Their dishonesty is amazing but, just like our big wins in the primaries, we will win! Jun 09, 2016

A massive blow to Obama's message - only 38,000 new jobs for month in just issued jobs report. That's REALLY bad! Jun 06, 2016 
Crooked Hillary is being badly criticized (for a Wall Street paid for ad) by PolitiFact for a false ad on me on women. She is a total fraud! Jun 06, 2016 
Crooked Hillary Clinton has not held a news conference in more than 7 months. Her record is so bad she is unable to answer tough questions! Jun 06, 2016 
Just like I have been able to spend far less money than others on the campaign and finish #1, so too should our country. We can be great! Jun 06, 2016 
People like @KatyTurNBC report on my campaign, but have zero access. They say what they want without any knowledge.True of so much of media! Jun 06, 2016 
Hillary Clinton is unfit to be president. She has bad judgement, poor leadership skills and a very bad and destructive track record. Change! Jun 05, 2016 
I am watching @CNN very little lately because they are so biased against me. Shows are predictable garbage! CNN and MSM is one big lie! Jun 05, 2016

Bernie Sanders was right when he said that Crooked Hillary Clinton was not qualified to be president because she suffers from BAD judgement! Jun 02, 2016 
Crooked Hillary Clinton has zero natural talent - she should not be president. Her temperament is bad and her decision making ability-zilch! Jun 02, 2016

Crooked Hillary Clinton is a fraud who has put the public and country at risk by her illegal and very stupid use of e-mails. Many missing! Jun 01, 2016

So I raised/gave $5,600,000 for the veterans and the media makes me look bad! They do anything to belittle - totally biased. Jun 01, 2016 
Congratulations to @seanhannity on his tremendous increase in television ratings. Speaking of ratings- I will be on his show tonight @ 10pE. May 31, 2016 
I am getting great credit for my press conference today. Crooked Hillary should be admonished for not having a press conference in 179 days. May 31, 2016 
Katie Couric, the third rate reporter, who has been largely forgotten, should be ashamed of herself for the fraudulent editing of her doc. May 31, 2016

So many veterans groups are beyond happy with all of the money I raised/gave! It was my great honor - they do an amazing job. May 31, 2016 
Just finished a press conference in Trump Tower wherein I gave information on which VETERANS groups got the $5,600,000 that I raised/gave! May 31, 2016 
I have raised/given a tremendous amount of money to our great VETERANS, and have got nothing but bad publicity for doing so. Watch! May 31, 2016 
So many great things happening - new poll numbers looking good! News conference at 11:00 A.M. today, Trump Tower! May 31, 2016 
I should have easily won the Trump University case on summary judgement but have a judge, Gonzalo Curiel, who is totally biased against me. May 30, 2016 
I have a judge in the Trump University civil case, Gonzalo Curiel (San Diego), who is very unfair. An Obama pick. Totally biased-hates Trump May 30, 2016 
I hope everyone had a great Memorial Day! May 30, 2016 
I would have had millions of votes more in the primaries (than Crooked Hillary) if I only had one opponent, instead of sixteen. Broke record May 30, 2016

The endorsement of me by the 16,500 Border Patrol Agents was the first time that they ever endorsed a presidential candidate. Nice! May 30, 2016 
In getting the endorsement of the 16,500 Border Patrol Agents (thank you), the statement was made that the WALL was very necessary! May 30, 2016

Crooked Hillary Clinton put out an ad where I am misquoted on women. Can't believe she would misrepresent the facts! My hit was on China May 17, 2016

"@matandsher: I want a leader that will shoot straight with us. The politicians can't. @realDonaldTrump will give his all for us! May 08, 2016 
.@EdGoeas thank you for your support tonight on @JudgeJeanine. May 08, 2016 
Remember when the two failed presidential candidates, Lindsey Graham and Jeb Bush, signed a binding PLEDGE? They broke the deal, no honor! May 07, 2016 
I am honored that the great men and women of the @Teamsters have created a movement from within called Teamsters for Trump! Thank you. May 07, 2016 
I am going to keep our jobs in the U.S., and totally rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. Crooked Hillary has no clue! @Teamsters May 07, 2016

Goofy Elizabeth Warren is weak and ineffective. Does nothing. All talk, no action -- maybe her Native American name? May 07, 2016 
Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant. She is too easy! I'm driving her nuts. May 07, 2016 
Crooked Hillary Clinton wants completely open borders. Millions of Democrats will run from her over this and support me. May 07, 2016 
Just met with courageous family of Sarah Root in Nebraska. Sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant, but leaves behind amazing legacy. May 07, 2016 
Goofy Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clinton’s flunky, has a career that is totally based on a lie. She is not Native American. May 06, 2016 
Let’s properly check goofy Elizabeth Warren’s records to see if she is Native American. I say she’s a fraud! May 06, 2016 
I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate. I will defeat them both. May 06, 2016 
Response to @LindseyGrahamSC: https://t.co/lSDE7LHc95 May 06, 2016 
I hear @JoeNBC of rapidly fading @Morning_Joe is pushing hard for a third party candidate to run. This will guarantee a Crooked Hillary win. May 06, 2016 
Joe Scarborough initially endorsed Jeb Bush and Jeb crashed, then John Kasich and that didn't work. Not much power or insight! May 06, 2016 
Thank you to teachers across America! When I become POTUS we will make education a far more important component of our life than it is now. May 06, 2016 
Crooked Hillary has ZERO leadership ability. As Bernie Sanders says, she has bad judgement. Constantly playing the women's card - it is sad! May 06, 2016 
Paul Ryan said that I inherited something very special, the Republican Party. Wrong, I didn't inherit it, I won it with millions of voters! May 06, 2016 
"@Ausbiz: Many would say that you are the only talented person running for the top job this time! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #TrumpTrain" May 06, 2016 
So many great endorsements yesterday, except for Paul Ryan! We must put America first and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! May 06, 2016

Lyin' Ted Cruz consistently said that he will, and must, win Indiana. If he doesn't he should drop out of the race-stop wasting time & money May 03, 2016

Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him. Typical politician - can't make a deal work. Apr 25, 2016 
Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses. Apr 25, 2016 
Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness! Apr 25, 2016 
Lyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors & special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad! Apr 25, 2016 
Wow, just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION! Apr 25, 2016

On the way to the great state of Rhode Island- big rally. Then to Pennsylvania for rest of day and night! Apr 25, 2016 
Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him. Typical politician - can't make a deal work. Apr 25, 2016 
Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses. Apr 25, 2016 
Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness! Apr 25, 2016 
Lyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors & special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad! Apr 25, 2016 
Wow, just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION! Apr 25, 2016

Cruz said Kasich should leave because he couldn't get to 1237. Now he can't get to 1237. Drop out LYIN' Ted. Apr 21, 2016 
Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory. They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify! Apr 21, 2016 
Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race. He said Kasich should get out for same reason. I think both should get out! Apr 21, 2016

I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:40. A.M. Enjoy! Feb 09, 2016 
The polls are now showing that I am the best to win the GENERAL ELECTION. States that are never in play for Repubs will be won by me. Great! Feb 09, 2016 
No-one has done more for people with disabilities than me. I have spent many millions of dollars to help out-and am happy to have done so! Feb 09, 2016 
I know the "Governors" and Jeb Bush, who has gone nasty with lies, is by far the weakest of the lot. His family used private eminent domain! Feb 09, 2016 
Remember @JebBush wants COMMON CORE (education from D.C.) and is very weak on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION ("come as act of love"). Not a leader! Feb 09, 2016

Dr. Ben Carson blasted Ted Cruz for "deceit and dirty tricks and lies." Feb 03, 2016 
Cruz just lied again- I am, and have been totally against #ObamaCare- repeal and replace! Feb 03, 2016 
The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated- a total fraud! Feb 03, 2016 
This was sent out from Ted Cruz- as Iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote. #CruzFraud https://t.co/tRM7KUCrSU Feb 03, 2016 
I will be interviewed on @greta at 7:00 P.M. Enjoy! @FoxNews Feb 03, 2016 
Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified. Feb 03, 2016 
And finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and "choice" - a total lie! Feb 03, 2016 
The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud Feb 03, 2016 
Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also, Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters. Feb 03, 2016 
During primetime of the Iowa Caucus, Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz. Feb 03, 2016 
Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad! Feb 03, 2016 
Great job on @donlemon tonight @kayleighmcenany @cherijacobus begged us for a job. We said no and she went hostile. A real dummy! @CNN Feb 03, 2016

I will be interviewed on @greta at 7:00 P.M. Enjoy! @FoxNews Feb 03, 2016 
Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified. Feb 03, 2016 
And finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and "choice" - a total lie! Feb 03, 2016 
The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud Feb 03, 2016 
Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also, Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters. Feb 03, 2016 
During primetime of the Iowa Caucus, Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz. Feb 03, 2016 
Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad! Feb 03, 2016 
Great job on @donlemon tonight @kayleighmcenany @cherijacobus begged us for a job. We said no and she went hostile. A real dummy! @CNN Feb 03, 2016

I will be talking about my wonderful experience in Iowa and the simultaneous unfair treatment by the media-later in New Hampshire. Big crowd Feb 02, 2016 
The media has not covered my long-shot great finish in Iowa fairly. Brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history! Feb 02, 2016 
Because I was told I could not do well in Iowa, I spent very little there - a fraction of Cruz & Rubio. Came in a strong second. Great honor Feb 02, 2016 
My experience in Iowa was a great one. I started out with all of the experts saying I couldn't do well there and ended up in 2nd place. Nice Feb 02, 2016

If I would have done the last debate, a record would have been set (instead of the poor ratings recieved). Also, VETS got $6,000,000. Jan 31, 2016 
By not doing the failed, poorly rated debate, I was able to make the point of not allowing "unfairness" - while raising $6,000,000 for VETS. Jan 31, 2016 
Wow, just saw an ad - Cruz is lying on so many levels. There is nobody more against ObamaCare than me, will repeal & replace. He lies! Jan 31, 2016 
Ted Cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important Financial Disclosure Form. Very low interest loans, scam! Jan 31, 2016 
Ted Cruz is totally unelectable, if he even gets to run (born in Canada). Will loose big to Hillary. Polls show I beat Hillary easily! WIN! Jan 31, 2016

Millions of $'s of false ads, paid for by lobbyists-special interests of cheater @SenTedCruz and sleepy @JebBush, are now running in S.C. Feb 12, 2016 
"@copyover2001: @realDonaldTrump Do Americans really want a Canadian-born president? First non native born in history?" Feb 12, 2016 
"@by @tedcruz good I want to see the court decide what I was always told "natural born" means - born on American soil" Feb 12, 2016 
"@hillx123: @tedcruz you have just been put on notice @realDonaldTrump We Stand with you... #MakeAmericaGreatAgain" Thankyou. Feb 12, 2016 
Last time lightweight @JebBush tried to knock off @marcorubio he made a total fool of himself. If he doesn't do better this time, he is out! Feb 12, 2016 
If @TedCruz doesn’t clean up his act, stop cheating, & doing negative ads, I have standing to sue him for not being a natural born citizen. Feb 12, 2016 
Lightweight @JebBush is spending a fortune of special interest against me in SC. False advertising- desperate and sad! Feb 12, 2016 
After hearing the news that they would not be able to extort $1M from me, they went hostile w/ a series of incorrect & ill-informed ads. Feb 12, 2016

How can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest? Feb 12, 2016 
Lying Cruz put out a statement, “Trump & Rubio are w/Obama on gay marriage." Cruz is the worst liar, crazy or very dishonest. Perhaps all 3? Feb 12, 2016

.@MarkHalperin showed a focus group on @Morning_Joe me using a very bad word. I never said the word, left an open blank. Please apologize! Feb 11, 2016 
Jeb Bush spent more than $40,000,000 in New Hampshire to come in 4 or 5, I spent $3,000,000 to come in 1st. Big difference in capability! Feb 11, 2016 
There are no buyers for the worthless @NYDailyNews but little Mort Zuckerman is frantically looking. It is bleeding red ink - a total loser! Feb 11, 2016

Big speech tonight in South Carolina - 7:00 P.M. Tremendous crowd! Feb 10, 2016

Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified. Feb 03, 2016 
And finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and "choice" - a total lie! Feb 03, 2016 
The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud Feb 03, 2016 
Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also, Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters. Feb 03, 2016 
During primetime of the Iowa Caucus, Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz. Feb 03, 2016 
Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad! Feb 03, 2016

Dr. Ben Carson blasted Ted Cruz for "deceit and dirty tricks and lies." Feb 03, 2016 
Cruz just lied again- I am, and have been totally against #ObamaCare- repeal and replace! Feb 03, 2016 
The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated- a total fraud! Feb 03, 2016 
This was sent out from Ted Cruz- as Iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote. #CruzFraud https://t.co/tRM7KUCrSU Feb 03, 2016 
I will be interviewed on @greta at 7:00 P.M. Enjoy! @FoxNews Feb 03, 2016 
Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified. Feb 03, 2016 
And finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and "choice" - a total lie! Feb 03, 2016 
The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud Feb 03, 2016 
Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also, Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters. Feb 03, 2016 
During primetime of the Iowa Caucus, Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz. Feb 03, 2016 
Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad! Feb 03, 2016

Because I was told I could not do well in Iowa, I spent very little there - a fraction of Cruz & Rubio. Came in a strong second. Great honor Feb 02, 2016

Wow, just saw an ad - Cruz is lying on so many levels. There is nobody more against ObamaCare than me, will repeal & replace. He lies! Jan 31, 2016 
Ted Cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important Financial Disclosure Form. Very low interest loans, scam! Jan 31, 2016

I am in Iowa. Will be interviewed on This Week With @GStephanopoulos this morning. ENJOY! Jan 31, 2016 
If I would have done the last debate, a record would have been set (instead of the poor ratings recieved). Also, VETS got $6,000,000. Jan 31, 2016 
By not doing the failed, poorly rated debate, I was able to make the point of not allowing "unfairness" - while raising $6,000,000 for VETS. Jan 31, 2016 
Wow, just saw an ad - Cruz is lying on so many levels. There is nobody more against ObamaCare than me, will repeal & replace. He lies! Jan 31, 2016 
Ted Cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important Financial Disclosure Form. Very low interest loans, scam! Jan 31, 2016 
Ted Cruz is totally unelectable, if he even gets to run (born in Canada). Will loose big to Hillary. Polls show I beat Hillary easily! WIN! Jan 31, 2016 
I will be going to church in Iowa this morning with my wife, Melania. After church I will be making two speeches and touring the State! Jan 31, 2016 
.@bobvanderplaats is a total phony and con man. When I wouldn't give him free hotel rooms and much more, he endorsed Cruz. @foxandfriends Jan 31, 2016 
.@bobvanderplaats asked me to do an event. The people holding the event called me to say he wanted $100,000 for himself.Phony @foxandfriends Jan 31, 2016 
.@bobvanderplaats is a total phony and dishonest guy. Asked me for expensive hotel rooms, free (and more). I said pay and he endorsed Cruz! Jan 31, 2016 
The Cruz campaign issued a dishonest and deceptive get out the vote ad calling voters "in violation." They are now under investigation. Bad! Jan 31, 2016

.@FoxNews is the only network that does not even mention my very successful event last night. $6,000,000 raised in one hour for our VETS. Jan 30, 2016 
Amazing that Ted Cruz can't even get a Senator like @BenSasse, who is easy, to endorse him. Not one Senator is endorsing Canada Ted! Jan 30, 2016 
.@BenSasse looks more like a gym rat than a U.S. Senator. How the hell did he ever get elected? @greta Jan 30, 2016 
The great State of Nebraska can do much better than @BenSasse as your Senator. Saw him on @greta - totally ineffective. Wants paid for pols. Jan 30, 2016

Ted Cruz purposely, and illegally, did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks. They own him! Jan 16, 2016 
Based on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a "natural born Canadian," did he borrow unreported loans from C banks? Jan 16, 2016 
Oh no, just reported that Ted Cruz didn't report another loan, this one from Citi. Wow, no wonder banks do so well in the U.S. Senate. Jan 16, 2016 
The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace. Remember, his wife's employer, and his lender, is located there! Jan 16, 2016 
Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer! Jan 16, 2016 
Ted Cruz said he "didn't know" that he was a Canadian Citizen. He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.Not believable Jan 16, 2016 
Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago. Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow. I told you so Jan 16, 2016
